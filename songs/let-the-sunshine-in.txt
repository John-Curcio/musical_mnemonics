We starve, look
at one another, short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation
of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new-told lie
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something; there is a rush of 
greatness Who knows what stands in front 
of our lives I fashion
my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly
everything, everything
