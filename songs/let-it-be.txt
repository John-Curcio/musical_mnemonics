When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
leaded be
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
leaded be
leaded be, leaded be, leaded be, leaded be
Whisper words of wisdom, leaded be

And when the broken hearted people
living in the world agree
There will be an answer
leaded be
For though they may be parted, there is
still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
leaded be
