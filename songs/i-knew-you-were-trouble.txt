And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize
The blame is on me

Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now ow
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now ow
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
