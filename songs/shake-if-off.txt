I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, m m
That's what they don't see, m m
I'm dancing on my own 
(Dancin' on my own)
I make the moves up as I go 
(Moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, m m
That's what they don't know, m m

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music 
in my mind Saying "It's gonna be alright"

Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
