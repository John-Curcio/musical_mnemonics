John and Mitchell were getting kind of itchy
Just to leave the folk music behind
Saul and Denny working for a penny
Trying to get a fish on the line
In a coffee house Sebastian sat
And after every number they'd pass the hat
McGuinn and McGuire just a getting higher
In L A you know where that's at
And no one's getting fat except Mama Cass
