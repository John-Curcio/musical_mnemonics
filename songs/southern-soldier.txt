I'll place my knapsack on my back
My rifle on my shoulder
I'll march away to the firing line
And kill that Yankee soldier
I'll kill that Yankee soldier
I'll march away to the firing line
And kill that Yankee soldier

I'll bid farewell to my wife and child
Farewell to my aged mother
Go and join in the bloody strife
'Til this cruel war is over
'Til this cruel war is over
I'll go and join in the bloody strife
'Til this cruel war is over
