Cut the protesting, forget the excuses
We want information, get up off the floor

We have the papers we need to arrest him
You know his movements, we know the law

Your help in this matter won't go un rewarded

We'll pay you in silver and cash on the nail
We just need to know where the soldiers can find him

With no crowd around him and then we can't fail

I don't want your blood money

Oh, that doesn't matter - our expenses are good

I don't need your blood money!

But you might as well take it; we think that you should

Think of the things you can do with that money
Choose any charity, give to the poor
We've noted your motives, we've noted your feelings
This isn't blood money, it's a 
a fee 
a fee nothing more
