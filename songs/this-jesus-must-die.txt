What then to do about Jesus of Nazareth?
Miracle wonder man, hero of fools
No riots, no army, no fighting, no slogans.
One thing I'll say for him -- Jesus is cool.
We dare not leave him to his own devices.
His half witted fans will get out of control.
But how can we stop him? His glamour increases
By leaps every moment; he's top of the poll.

I see bad things arising.
The crowd crown him king; which the Romans would ban.
I see blood and destruction,
Our elimination because of one man.
Blood and destruction because of one man.

Because, because, because of one man.
