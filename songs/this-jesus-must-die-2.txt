Fools, you have no perception!
The stakes we are gamble are fright n lee high!
We must crush him completely,
So like John before him, this Jesus must die.
For the sake of the nation, this Jesus must die.

What then to do about this Jesus man yaw

How do we deal with a carpenter king?

Where do we start with a man who is bigger
Than John was when John did his baptism thing?
