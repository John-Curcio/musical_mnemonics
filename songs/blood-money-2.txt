I don't want your blood money

Oh, that doesn't matter our expenses are good

I don't need your blood money!

But you might as well take it; we think that you should

Think of the things you can do with that money
Choose any charity, give to the poor
We've noted your motives, we've noted your feelings
This isn't blood money, it's a fee nothing more
