Christ, you know I love you;
did you see I waved?
I believe in you and God, so tell me that I'm saved!
Christ, you know I love you;
did you see I waved?
I believe in you and God, so tell me that I'm saved
Jesus, I am with you;
touch me, touch me, Jesus!
Jesus, I am on your side;
kiss me, kiss, me Jesus!

Christ, what more do you need to convince you
That you've made it and you're easily as strong
As the filth from Rome who rape our country
And who've terrorized our people for so long?

Christ, you know I love you;
did you see I waved?
I believe in you and God, so tell me that I'm saved!
Christ, you know I love you;
did you see I waved?
I believe in you and God, so tell me that I'm saved
Jesus, I am with you;
touch me, touch me, Jesus!
Jesus, I am on your side;
kiss me, kiss, me Jesus!
