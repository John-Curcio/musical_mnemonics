fermat little theorem
a and p are co prime
a to the power of
just one less than p
# is one modulo p
equiv one mod p


proof by counting two ways
first reduce a by modulo p
consider p length strings
# a different letters
alphabet of size a

drop one symbol strings
the left overs
form groups of size p
# group into peas
