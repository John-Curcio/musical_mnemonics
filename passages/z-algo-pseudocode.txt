z function 
finds
longest prefix match
loop through i
up to n
keep track of left and right
if i less than right
set z i to min of
right minus i
z at left hops left of i
while i plus z i 
less than n
and
s at z i
equals
s z i plus i
increment z at i
if i plus z i past right
then set l to i
set r to i plus z i
