Bolzano and Weierstrass say
every bounded sequence has a
convergent subsequence

Start with
a sub n you know
it's bounded
Split the interval in two parts

at least one half
holds 
infinite
lee many terms

et cetera

# nested sequence
# of closed intervals

# implies
# accumulation point

Compactness in metric spaces
Existence of limit points
continuous function roots
Measure theory
