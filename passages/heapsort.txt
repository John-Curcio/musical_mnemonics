Heapsort
takes
O
n log n time
O 
one space

for i
in range
# from
# n div two minus one
n int div two minus one
# half n minus one
# we call heapify on nums i n
down
to zero
we
call heapify
on
# on nums i n
nums n i
# for i in range
next loop
for i from
n minus one
to one
swap nums
at zero and i
and
call 
heapify 
nums i zero
