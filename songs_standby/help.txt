Help I need somebody
Help not just anybody
Help you know I need someone
help
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
but now these days are gone
I'm not so self assured
now I find I've changed my mind
And opened up the doors
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me
