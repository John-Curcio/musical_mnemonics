Listen Jesus I don't like what I see.
All I ask is that you listen to me.
And remember,
I've been your right hand man all along.
You have set them all on fire.
They think they've found the new Messiah.
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong.
I remember when this whole thing began.
No talk of God then, we called you a man.
And believe me,
my admiration for you hasn't died.
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way.
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied.
Nazareth, your famous son
should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood He'd have made good.
Tables, chairs, and oaken chests
would have suited Jesus best.
He'd have caused nobody harm;
no one alarm.
Listen, Jesus, do you care for your race?
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied; have you forgotten how put down we are?
