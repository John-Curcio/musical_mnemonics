I must be mad thinking I'll be remembered - yes
I must be out of my head!
Look at your blank faces! My name will mean nothing
Ten minutes after I'm dead!
One of you denies me
One of you betrays me
Peter will deny me in just a few hours
Three times will deny me - and that's not all I see
One of you here dining, one of my twelve chosen
Will leave to betray me
Cut out the dramatics! You know very well who -
Why don't you go do it?
You want me to do it?
Hurry, they're waiting
If you knew why I do it...
I don't care why you do it!
To think I admired you, for now I despise you
You liar - you Judas
You want me to do it!
What if I just stayed here and ruined your ambition?
Christ, you deserve it!
Hurry, you fool, hurry and go
Save me your speeches, I don't wanna know - go!
