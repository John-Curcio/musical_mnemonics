It was twenty years ago today
Seargent Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Seargent Pepper Lonely Hearts Club Band

We're Seargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
We're Seargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Seargent Pepper's lonely, Seargent Pepper's lonely
Seargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
