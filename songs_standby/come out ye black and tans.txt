I was born on a Dublin street where the loyal drums did beat
And those loving English feet, they walked all over us
And every single night
when me dad would come home tight
He'd invite the neighbours out with this chorus

Come out ye black and tans
Come out and fight me like a man
Show your wife how you won medals down in Flanders
Tell her how the I R A
Made you run like hell away
From the green and lovely lanes of Killashandra
