You sad pathetic man
see where you've brought us to
Our ideals die around us, all because of you
But the saddest cut of all:
Someone has to turn you in
Like a common criminal,
like a wounded animal
Like a jaded mandarin
A jaded mandarin
A jaded faded jaded faded jaded mandarin
Get out! They're waiting! Get out!
They're waiting for you
Every time I look at you, I don't understand
Why you let the things you did get so out of hand
You'd have managed better if you'd had it planned
